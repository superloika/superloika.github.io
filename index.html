          <h2>Hi, I'm Kaloy!</h2>
          <p>
            I fell in love with computer programming since the early part of my
            high school days. I wrote code just for fun but as I've read
            articles and tutorials on the internet, it gradually made me even
            more curious. I tried to solve some famous problems like how to
            generate fibonacci sequence, sort an array, and a lot more. It
            became part of my daily routine. Instead of playing computer games
            like the other kids do, I wrote code. It was fun but overwhelming
            sometimes specially when I'm stucked with an annoying bug. C/C++ and
            Visual Basic was my first two languages by the way. I dug deeper
            into programming and tried to learn other languages.

            I finished my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Bohol Island
            State University, Balilihan, Bohol, Philippines. I studied Software
            Engineering, System Analysis and Design, Web Development, Mobile
            Application Development, and Graphic Design. I am not a pro in terms
            of programming, I just love it. For me, it is not just a skill, it
            is more than that.. it's a passion. Knowing how to code is something
            like possessing a superpower. It makes you stand out amongst others.
            Gabe Newell once said, "The programmers of today are the future
            wizards of tomorrow".
